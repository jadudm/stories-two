<p>For the moment, let's work with the assumption that we need <b><span class="howmanystaff"></span> staff</b> billing <br><b>48 weeks/year</b> at <b>32 hours/week</b> in order to dig out of the $<span class="fixed"></span>M overhead.</p>

<p>This is a <i>tidy</i> assumption.</p>

<p>But, there is complexity waiting in the wings.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Management</li>
    <li>Hiring</li>
    <li>Staffing</li>
    <li>Business Development</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm going to take the set of assumptions laid out here (<span class="howmanystaff"></span> staff, 48 weeks, 32 hours/week), and see how the picture changes with each of these new twists.</p>

<p>Then, after exploring these three challenges, I'll bring them all together in one model.</p>

<p>So. [Bring forth the cat wranglers!]({{ site.baseurl }}/meow/)</p>
