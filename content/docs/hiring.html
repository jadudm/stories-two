<p>Many of our hires are 2/2s, meaning a two-year term potentially renewable for an additional two years. </p>

<p>Practically, <b>a 2/2 hire lasts anywhere from 1-3 years</b>. Because finding another job takes time, and cannot always be timed neatly, we tend to lose staff before they spend a full four years at 18F.</p>

<p><span style="color: red;"><b>18F sees roughly <span class="turnover"></span>% turnover in staff every year</b></span>.</p>

<p>If we need <b><span class="howmanystaff"></span> staff</b> to dig out of the $<span class="fixed"></span>M hole, we need to be hiring <b><span class="annualhires"></span> people every year</b> just to maintain billable staff. </p>

<p>If we need <b><span class="moreherdingstaff"></span> staff</b> (to carry management), that means we would need to be hiring <b><span class="moreherdinghires"></span> people every year</b> just to maintain numbers. That, and we're potentially going to be rotating people out of billable roles into management roles, so we'll probably need to hire 2-3 more/year to backfill.</p>

<p><b>Hiring is rough</b>.</p>
