title: How Many Staff?
weight: 40
---

<p>Let's ask the question another way.</p>

<p>If we need to bill 66kh in a year to clear ${{ site.data.constants.fixed }}M, how many staff is that *depending on how many weeks and hours the staff work*?</p>

<p>If staff bill 52 weeks/year, 40h/week, we apparently need <span class="staffneeded"></span> staff to dig out of the hole.</p>

<p>If staff work <b><span id="weeksperyear"></span> weeks/year</b>, and bill <b><span id="hoursperweek"></span> hours/week</b>, we need <b><span id="staffneeded"></span> staff</b> to clear the fixed overhead.</p>

<p>
    We are not going to work 18F staff 52 weeks/year.
</p>

<p>
    If everyone takes their full PTO every year, that's two weeks. So, the maximum number of weeks/year we should consider possible for a staff member to bill time is 50. However, there's more to reality. For example, there's a lot of slowdown around the winter holidays; does that mean there are fewer billable weeks in the year? 
</p>

<p>
    Also, staff with more years in the federal government will accrue PTO at a faster rate, meaning they have anywhere from 2-10 weeks/year they can potentially take off. Parental leave and administrative leave also reduce the number of weeks that staff might bill. 
</p>

<p>
    For now, it would be good to <b>revisit the model and see how many staff we need (at the minimum) if we are billing fewer than 50 weeks/year</b>.
</p>

<p>
    In terms of hours/week, we hire people at the top of their field, and we are attempting to foster a culture of change and innovation within the federal government. <b>This is very hard work, and easily leads to burnout</b>. If we want our staff to be change-makers and innovators, we need to create a healthy space for collaboration and continued learning in community with others. 
</p>

<p>
    An innovative, high-performing workforce needs to bill fewer than 40 hrs/week. <b>32/hours week</b> is a <em>completely reasonable choice</em>. Note that "billing" fewer than 40 hrs/week does not mean <b>working</b> fewer than 40 hours per week. 18F staff have many (tacit, invisible) responsibilities that are not considered "billable."
</p>

<p>
    Failure to create space for change and innovation materially damages the people who work at 18F, the organization's culture, and quality of work we do.
