<p><i>If staff are working on hiring, they are not billing hours</i>.</p>

<p>Now, what about staffing?</p>

<div class="grid-row" style="padding-top: 3em;">
    <div class="grid-col-12" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
        <p><small>Staff</small></p>
       <div id="sliderSH"></div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="grid-row">
    <canvas id="SH"></canvas>
</div>
<div class="grid-row" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 2em;">
    <div id="message" style="align: text-center;">
    &nbsp;
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    <b>I'm modeling time lost to hiring as time that must be made up by hiring additional staff.</b>
</p>
<p>
    Whenever there is work that 18F staff does that is non-billable, we fall short of achieving cost-recoverability. On one hand, we could consider this part of the 8 hours/week that staff have for innovation and growth. However, from a staff perspective, taking part in hiring neither 1) contributes to their personal growth nor 2) advances their billable projects. 
</p>

<p> 
    Therefore, I'm going to model all non-billable work as time that needs to be made up by additional billable staff time. This increases the number of staff we need to achieve cost recoverability.

<p>
    An interview requires:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Between 1-2 hours of phone work.
    </li>
    <li>
        An interview cycle, involving 5 hoursÂ of staff time.
    </li>
    <li>
        A report-out post-interview, another 5 hours of staff time.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    When new staff join, they typically have 80 hours of on-boarding time. This is non-billable.
</p>

<p>
    New staff require orientation, some of which is provided by staff. This is non-billable; call this another 10 hours (for the new hire and existing staff... so, 20 hours).
</p>

<p>
    A hire  (conservatively) hits the bottom line as <span class="onboarding"></span> hours of non-billable time.
</p>

<p>
    That time must be made up. Making up time means having people to do the work.
