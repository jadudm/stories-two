           <em>Such a good commercial</em>. It's like Ansel Adams met the Pythons.

        <p>
            Modeling so far suggests we're rolling around $<span class="doublefixed"></span>M/year. That's probably going to require some people keeping track of people.
        </p>
        <p>
            To start, let's assume some <b>full-time</b> management positions:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Director of Ops</li>
            <li>Director of Engineering</li>
            <li>Director of Design and Content</li>
            <li>Director of Product and Strategy</li>
            <li><i>Solver of Problems</i></li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            I don't know what a "solver of problems" is, but every organization probably needs one.
        </p>
        <p>
            How many more staff do we need to cover the cost of having management?

<p>
    Currently, 18F utilizes a model where 1) we rotate leadership positions, and 2) they are not full-time.
</p>

<p>
    I believe a good argument could be made that staff should "keep their toe in." That is, I think it is good for a Director of Engineering to still be engineeringing.
</p>

<p>
    However, I model management's time as if they are pure overhead. Modeling a Director as if they are 25% billable is too much detail, and ultimately is lost in the noise of reality.
</p>

<p>
    I think rotating leadership positions is an excellent idea. A better model might be to staff more junior members of staff to leadership positions, with the outgoing Director serving as a mentor. This would provide greater continuity. However, it likely requires that 18F finds a way to hire more 4/4 staff, and fewer 2/2s.
